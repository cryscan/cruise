Not really, this is not a simple game of rock-paper-scissors. Before duel with the opponent, you are allowed to negotiate and freely trade all resources - stars, coins and cards with them. You can probably guess what resources **they** have from talking to them and their trading tendencies, which could be used to predict what card they may draw in the upcoming duel. But be careful, they may also be good at disguising and your action and words may reveal what cards you have...
