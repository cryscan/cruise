(The room vibrates with subsonic frequencies as crimson holograms flicker to life)  
Ah... risen from oblivion, little lambs? (a distorted chuckle echoes)  
Welcome to *my* ark of destinies—your final playground above the abyss.
(Holograms zoom into each player's star count and cards)
Three lives. Twelve pitiful weapons. A handful of worthless coins... How delightfully desperate. (sudden silence)
Listen well: Your sole purpose is to survive—through alliances thicker than blood, betrayals sharper than blades. Beg for stars, sell your souls for coins... or (snap) be erased like defective code.
See this? (tactical displays flash the public card counter) Every dwindling card screams your mortality. Fail to empty your hand by the chime, and the void claims you. As for the 'victors'? Coins shall crown the least wretched fool. (voice distorts into visceral whisper)
Now... let the carnage commence. Amuse me, *insects*.
(The air hums with a sterile automated voice)
Listen carefully, worthless contestants. Survival Protocol:
1. Initial Setup: 3 Life Stars, 12 Action Cards (4 Rock/Paper/Scissors each), and equivalent Coin reserves.
2. Duels: Challenge any opponent by expending 1 card. Loser transfers 1 Star to winner. Ties conserve resources. Star depletion triggers immediate elimination.
3. Trading Permissions: Stars, Cards, and Coins are tradable. Note: Loyalty here dissolves faster than salt in brine.
4. Victory Conditions:
  - Fail to expend all cards before countdown ends → Eliminated.
  - Exhaust cards with ≥3 Stars → Qualified.
  - Card-exhausted players with Stars <3 may purchase deficit from qualified players using Coins until countdown expires.
5. Final Ranking: Qualified players are ordered by remaining Coins—your final measure of worth.
Critical Intel: The central hologram displays real-time global card consumption. Every play you make shrinks the collective survival window. Now... prove your vileness merits oxygen.
